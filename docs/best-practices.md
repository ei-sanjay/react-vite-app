# Best practices

## Code organization

- Colocate feature UI, hooks, and tests under `src/features/<domain>/`.
- Prefer small modules with clear exports over “utils dump” files.
- Name features after domains (`billing`, `auth`), not technical junk drawers.
- Keep route files as composers — they should not own fetching or form schemas.

## HTTP & data

- Define one API slice per domain (or a carefully shared base API).
- Use `tagTypes` for cache invalidation instead of manual refetches when possible.
- Put auth in `prepareHeaders`.
- Prefer generated hooks in components; avoid dispatching raw endpoint actions unless needed.
- Treat server cache and client UI state as separate concerns.

## Linting & formatting

- Tooling: **ESLint + Prettier**
- ESLint for code quality; Prettier for consistent formatting (`eslint-config-prettier` disables conflicting rules)
- `lint:fix` runs `eslint src tests --fix` to auto-sort imports and apply safe fixes
- **Import order** (same for Biome and ESLint): npm packages → blank line → `@/` / relative → blank line → styles last
- Run lint before push; treat warnings as debt with a burn-down plan.
- Husky **pre-commit** runs lint-staged; **commit-msg** runs commitlint; **pre-push** runs `pnpm run test`.
- After `git init`, run `pnpm install` so the `prepare` script can install Husky hooks.

## Environment variables

- Never commit `.env`.
- Prefix client-visible vars for your bundler (`VITE_*`).
- Validate required env at boot for production deploys.
- Document every variable in `.env.example` with a one-line purpose.

## Testing strategy

- Unit/integration with **Vitest + React Testing Library** for components and feature behavior.
- Prefer `getByRole` / label text over test IDs.
- Mock network at the domain boundary (`services/api` or RTK endpoints), not inside random UI helpers.
- E2E with **Cypress** for critical user journeys (load home, submit form).
- Keep e2e thin: happy paths + one failure path per critical flow.
- Storybook for isolated UI development and visual review.
- Write stories for states (loading, empty, error, success), not only the happy path.

Aim for: fast unit tests on logic, fewer integration tests on features, thin e2e on happy paths.

## Accessibility

- Prefer semantic HTML (`button`, `label`, `nav`) before ARIA.
- Ensure keyboard focus order matches visual order.
- Pair every input with a visible label; surface async success/errors with `aria-live` and a stable `data-testid` for tests.

## Deployment notes

1. `pnpm build`
2. Serve the bundler output (`dist/` / `build/`) behind HTTPS.
3. Configure SPA fallback to `index.html` for client routes.
4. Inject production env vars in the host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, nginx, etc.).
5. Enable error tracking DSN in production only.

## Production checklist

- [ ] Env vars documented and set
- [ ] Lint + tests in CI
- [ ] Bundle analyzed for accidental secrets
- [ ] Monitoring verified with a test event
- [ ] Accessibility pass on primary flows
- [ ] Error states designed for `/posts` and `/feedback`
- [ ] Auth expiry path handled (401 → re-login / token refresh)
